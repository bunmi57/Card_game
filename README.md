War Card Game

Overview of the game: wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)

objective of the game: Win all of the cards.

The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack. 
In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck—this is a "battle"—and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack.
King is high, and jack is lower

If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "war". 
Each player takes an additional set of 5 cards.
Then each player pulls out one card, The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all the cards on the table to the bottom of their deck.
If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's

The cycle repeats untill a play has all the cards and wins.
